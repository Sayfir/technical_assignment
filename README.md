# Why i used Cypress 
Cypress is self-sufficient framework with integrated runner, assertions, reporting system (Dashboard) and ability to test API without adding additional modules. It is easy to setup and maintain. The key point for me is that in comparison to Selenium it is working dirrectly with browser objects so all this troubles with constantly updating drivers are eliminated.   

**How to initialize:**

1- Install Node JS and ensure of installation by node -v and npm -v

2- Open project

3- Run npm install package.json in terminal 


**Scripts to run tests:**
npm run runAllTests-headless,
npm run runAllTests-headed,
npm run runAllTests-chrome,
npm run runOnlyUITests,
npm run runOnlyAPITests
